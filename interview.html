	<p><b>Where are you from? Do you miss it?</b></p>
		<p>I’m from Moscow, Russia and sometimes I do miss it but not so much.</p>
	<p><b>What are you studying at the academy?</b></p>
		<p>I am studying Graphic Design.</p>
	<p><b>What kind of job would you look for after you graduate and where?</b></p>
		<p>I would like to be a graphic designer for the first 2-3 years, try different things, since graphic design is such a broad career, I like motion graphics and UX/UI design as well, so I have to decide what I actually want to do and which one I’d like more.</p>

	<p><b>What do you like to do in your free time?</b></p>
		<p>I do not get any free time since I am a student-athlete, it’s constant practices, treatment for injuries, classes and homework. I might go hang out with my friends on the weekend sometimes but it’s getting harder and harder to do because the basketball season has started.</p>
	<p><b>Name your top 5 tv shows.</b></p>
		<p>Dexter, Criminal Minds, Grey’s anatomy, How To Get Away With Murder, The Resident</p>
	<p><b>If you could travel anywhere, where would you like to go?</b></p>
		<p>I would love to go to Madagascar, Bahamas, England and Italy.</p>
	<p><b>What's your favorite food?</b></p>
		<p>My favorite food is curly fries, sometimes spicy, at the moment but it changes all the time.</p>
