	<h2>The Persona of Language</h2>
	<h3>October 29 | Divij Prakash</h3>
	<img src="blog1.jpg">
	<p>
		Language has granted us cognition.
It is as the softness in the morning sun , and the sweet euphony of flowing water - it has brought us home in an almost alien world. Geometric symbols , stimulating sounds , involuntary movement , with a pastel touch - we are morphed from modest beings to iridiscent , vital creators. We communicate , inherently producing life - a word constituted by peculiar letters , strung delicately together , in order to bring meaning , to an existence , constituted itself , by peculiar characters - the peculiar memories and moments that bring it definition.</p>

<p>We are brought to comprehend emotion , aesthetic - to appreciate the beauty of solitary moonlight , to envision it as a radiant mother watching over her innocent and learning children. Absorbing visions with this ability to perceive , emotions take shape within us , our naked souls sparkle with their essence. Our persona , our ka , our ƒÅtman breathes ; with this fragile sequence of vivid photographs and nostalgic melodies.</p>

<p>We shall be lost , when these scenes begin to fade and are swept , like broken sand in the aging wind. Present as faint beacons , gaining weight and becoming substance , perhaps these experiences appear on our inner bodies as birthmarks , affixed as we came to be.

	<h2>The Ruminating Ocean</h2>
	<h3>October 27 | Divij Prakash</h3>
	<img src="blog2.jpg">
	<p>Covered in layers, a girl lies asleep on a bed in the ocean. A euphony in the movement of the waves, their light dawn breeze have brought her to this forlorn place. The wood sways with the clement, aquamarine water as the morning light settles upon the scene. She is awoken by the weigh on her eyes.</p>

	<p>The water is burned away, and the steam rises into the open sky. The girl is alone here, as she stands up and struggles to see in the morning daze. In this monochrome reality, she is a beholder to a secret nation, a white forest. It is a dystopia of nothingness, a white upturned abyss. An empty forest - succumbed to an ancient rot.Faced with a sudden end to a sudden creation, she looks upon her grave - this land, with familiarity. What made a home inside her, brought out in the morning light.</p>

	<p>She extended into this desert, a part of her being. The violent sounds of Prokofiev flood her mind, as she is elevated into the aerial. With the rise and fall in the sound, she is both creator and destroyer. The ancient cities in the depths of her mind are born of the earth, and their reverses shoot out of the sky.</p>

	<p><i>She lay afloat at the center, as she felt everything.
	This barren world was
	never a dystopia at all,
	but clear white dream-space
	where her mind ruminates.</i></p>
