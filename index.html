	<h1>An introduction</h1>
	<p>I am a content creator from Hyderabad, India, currently studying advertising at The Academy of Art University in San Francisco, California. I've been a voracious consumer of media since I was very young, and as I grew older, consumption turned into creation. I'm passionate about turning ideas into written work, or visual - through design, films, and photography, in order to tell a moving story.</p>

	<p>
	My artistic philosophy is to create work that makes a personal connection with the audience, inviting them to dig deeper and explore the intricate details while evoking strong emotions. In that sense, my philosophy is two-fold: I aim for technical achievement as well as richness and depth in the message I am conveying. 
	</p>

	<p>The ideation part of the creative process is very exciting to me - as a blank sheet of paper can hold many possibilities. Not every idea is a good one, but there might be a couple in every hundred - seeing the seed come to life is a very satisfying feeling. I experiment a lot when I am working with any medium as there may be many ways to convey the same thing. The subtle nuances might amplify the work in many ways.
	</p>

	<p>I believe the right idea conveyed to the right person at the right time can have a life - changing effect, and that is what I strive to create. At the moment, I hope to build a career in art direction in the advertising field - turning a cold brand into something more humane.</p>
